## The Perfection Trap

We tell ourselves that we'll call more often, visit more frequently, or deepen our relationships. But then we get intimidated by the idea that we haven't talked in months. That first call back feels too big. What will we even say?

So we wait for the "perfect moment"—when we have more time, when we've thought of something really meaningful to share, when life has calmed down.

And we keep waiting.

## Perfection Is the Enemy

The truth is, relationships don't need perfection. They need consistency. A regular text that says "thinking of you" matters more than a perfectly crafted message that never gets sent.

A five-minute call beats the perfect phone call that never happens. Showing up as you are beats waiting to be in the perfect headspace.

## Build the Habit

Consistency is a habit. It's sending that message every week. It's having that coffee date every month. It's the small, regular actions that build trust and connection.

Start small. Pick one person. Pick one way to connect. Then commit to it consistently. That's how relationships grow.

The irony is that perfection is actually the enemy of connection. You don't need a perfectly crafted message. You don't need to wait for the ideal time. You don't need to have your life together before reaching out.

People don't want perfection from you. They want consistency. They want to know they can count on you showing up, even imperfectly.

## The Power of Small, Regular Actions

Consider two approaches:

**Approach 1 (Perfection):** Plan an elaborate dinner party to reconnect with old friends. Spend weeks organizing. Hope it's perfect. Most of the time, it doesn't happen.

**Approach 2 (Consistency):** Send a text to one friend each week. Five minutes. No preparation required. Year-round, these friends feel genuinely connected to you.

Approach 2 wins every single time.

## Why Consistency Matters

When you show up consistently, even imperfectly, you communicate something powerful:

- "You matter to me"
- "I think about you regularly"
- "I'm reliable"
- "This relationship is worth my time"

Consistency builds trust and deepens bonds in ways that occasional grand gestures never can.

## Start Where You Are

You don't need a perfect system or a perfect plan. You just need to start consistently. Pick one person. Commit to reaching out once a week. That's it. No perfection required.

Once that becomes a habit, add another person. Build from there.

The strongest relationships aren't built by perfectionists. They're built by people who show up consistently, imperfectly, with good intentions and regular action.
